Static file blogging engine w/o user interface.


Why?
==========

I blog in LiveJournal, but I dont trust LiveJournal to keep all my posts. For many reasons.

I setup self hosted Wordpress, but it is a source of maintenance pain, plus I post only for my friends and don't want to share it with the world.

I want to be able to post from my iOS devices, but I don't want to create new app for that.


Solution
==========

Create an XMLRPC server, pretending to be a WordPress Blog. It will save posts to Dropbox and publish them to LiveJournal via XMLRPC. Use Wordpress iOS app to post.


Current state
==========

Just an idea for now.
